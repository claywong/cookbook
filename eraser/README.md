#jQuery.eraser v0.4.2

a jQuery plugin that makes an image erasable (with mouse or touch movements)

This plugin replaces the targeted image by an interactive canvas that can be erased using touch or mouse inputs. You can specify a callback for completion and set the brush size.

Please note that I don't claim that the completion detection process is ultimately accurate. In fact you should rather use a completeRatio around 0.8 if you want a near-complete erase process.



#Check this :

This plug-in works with image or canvas elements but you must make sure that the images are fully loaded before calling the eraser(), or it won't work.


My conclusions are that the following code works in Safari, Chrome and Firefox on OS X and Windows, iOS, Android and BlackBerry browsers :


	function init ( event ) {
		$("#image").eraser();
	}
	addEventListener( "load", init, false );



#Usage :


To transform an image or canvas into an erasable canvas, just use this syntax :

	$('#yourImage').eraser();


To specify a brush size, add some options (default value is 40) :

	$('#yourImage').eraser( { size: 30 } );
	// and you can also change the size later :
	// $('#yourImage').eraser( "size", 30 } );


You can reset the canvas (back to the original image) with this code :

	$('#yourImage').eraser('reset');


And you can erase all the canvas' content by calling :

	$('#yourImage').eraser('clear');


To get a callback when 50% of the image has been erased, use this :

	$('#yourImage').eraser( {
		completeRatio: .5,
		completeFunction: showResetButton
	});
